## 8.1 Breadth-First Search (BFS)

**Breadth-First Search** explores all states at the current depth before moving to states at the next depth level. It uses a **queue** data structure to manage the search frontier.

### 8.1.1 How BFS Works

1. Start with the initial state in a queue
2. Remove the first state from the queue
3. If it's the goal, we're done
4. Otherwise, add all its successors to the end of the queue
5. Repeat until queue is empty or goal is found

### 8.1.2 BFS Characteristics

- **Complete**: Yes (if solution exists and branching factor is finite)
- **Optimal**: Yes (finds shortest path in terms of number of steps)
- **Time Complexity**: O(b^d) where b is branching factor, d is depth of solution
- **Space Complexity**: O(b^d) - needs to store all nodes at current level

### 8.1.3 BFS Implementation

```python
from collections import deque

def breadth_first_search(problem):
    """
    Implement Breadth-First Search algorithm.

    Args:
        problem: A SearchProblem instance

    Returns:
        list: Solution path if found, None if no solution exists
    """
    # Initialize the frontier with the initial state
    # Using deque for efficient queue operations
    frontier = deque([(problem.get_initial_state(), [problem.get_initial_state()])])

    # Keep track of visited states
    visited = set()

    # Statistics
    nodes_expanded = 0

    print("Starting Breadth-First Search...")

    while frontier:
        # Remove from front (queue behavior - FIFO)
        current_state, path = frontier.popleft()

        # Skip if already visited
        if current_state in visited:
            continue

        # Mark as visited
        visited.add(current_state)
        nodes_expanded += 1

        print(f"Exploring state: {current_state} (depth: {len(path) - 1})")

        # Check if goal reached
        if problem.is_goal(current_state):
            print(f"Goal found! Nodes expanded: {nodes_expanded}")
            return path

        # Add all successors to frontier
        actions = problem.get_actions(current_state)
        for action in actions:
            next_state = problem.get_result(current_state, action)

            if next_state not in visited:
                new_path = path + [next_state]
                frontier.append((next_state, new_path))

    print(f"No solution found. Nodes expanded: {nodes_expanded}")
    return None
```

### 8.1.4 Comparing DFS and BFS

Let's create a function to compare both algorithms:

```python
def compare_search_algorithms(problem):
    """
    Compare DFS and BFS on the same problem.

    Args:
        problem: A SearchProblem instance
    """
    print("=" * 50)
    print("COMPARING SEARCH ALGORITHMS")
    print("=" * 50)

    # Test DFS
    print("\n--- DEPTH-FIRST SEARCH ---")
    dfs_solution = depth_first_search(problem)

    print("\n--- BREADTH-FIRST SEARCH ---")
    bfs_solution = breadth_first_search(problem)

    # Compare results
    print("\n--- COMPARISON ---")
    if dfs_solution and bfs_solution:
        print(f"DFS solution length: {len(dfs_solution)}")
        print(f"BFS solution length: {len(bfs_solution)}")
        print(f"BFS optimal: {len(bfs_solution) <= len(dfs_solution)}")
    elif bfs_solution:
        print("BFS found solution, DFS did not")
    elif dfs_solution:
        print("DFS found solution, BFS did not")
    else:
        print("Neither algorithm found a solution")

# Test the comparison
compare_search_algorithms(maze_problem)
```

## 8.2 Comparing DFS and BFS

### 8.2.1 Side-by-Side Comparison

| Property         | DFS        | BFS         |
| ---------------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| Completeness     | No (loops) | Yes         |
| Optimality       | No         | Yes (steps) |
| Time Complexity  | O(b^m)     | O(b^d)      |
| Space Complexity | O(bm)      | O(b^d)      |

### 8.2.2 When to Use Each Algorithm

Add practical guidance:

- Use BFS when:
  - You need the shortest path
  - The solution is likely close to the root
- Use DFS when:
  - Memory is constrained
  - The solution is deep in the tree
  - You need any solution quickly

## 8.3 Practical Exercises

    """

## Key Takeaways

1. BFS guarantees optimality but requires more memory
2. Algorithm choice depends on problem constraints
3. Performance analysis helps select appropriate algorithms
4. More complex problems require careful state representation

> **Next Chapter Preview**: In Chapter 9, we'll learn about Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs), where we'll learn to solve problems by finding assignments that satisfy multiple constraints simultaneously, using techniques like backtracking and constraint propagation.
