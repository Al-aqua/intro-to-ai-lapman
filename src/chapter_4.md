## 4.3 Python Basics: Variables, Data Types, and Operators

### 4.3.1 Your First Python Program

Create a file called `hello.py` and write:

```python
print("Hello, AI World!")
```

Run it by typing in your terminal:

```bash
python hello.py
```

### 4.3.2 Variables

Variables in Python are used to store data. Unlike some languages, you don't need to declare the type explicitly.

```python
# Variable assignment
name = "Alice"
age = 25
height = 5.6
is_student = True

print(name)    # Output: Alice
print(age)     # Output: 25
print(height)  # Output: 5.6
print(is_student)  # Output: True
```

#### Variable Naming Rules:

- Must start with a letter or underscore
- Can contain letters, numbers, and underscores
- Case-sensitive (`age` and `Age` are different)
- Cannot use Python keywords (`if`, `for`, `class`, etc.)

```python
# Good variable names
student_name = "John"
total_score = 95
is_valid = True

# Bad variable names (avoid these)
# 2name = "John"      # Starts with number
# class = "Math"      # Python keyword
# student-name = "John"  # Contains hyphen
```

### 4.3.3 Data Types

Python has several built-in data types:

#### 1. Numbers

```python
# Integers
count = 42
negative_num = -17

# Floats (decimal numbers)
pi = 3.14159
temperature = -2.5

# You can check the type
print(type(count))      # <class 'int'>
print(type(pi))         # <class 'float'>
```

#### 2. Strings

```python
# String creation
message = "Hello, World!"
name = 'Python'
multiline = """This is a
multiline string"""

# String operations
first_name = "John"
last_name = "Doe"
full_name = first_name + " " + last_name  # Concatenation
print(full_name)  # Output: John Doe

# String methods
text = "artificial intelligence"
print(text.upper())      # ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
print(text.capitalize()) # Artificial intelligence
print(len(text))         # 22 (length of string)
```

#### 3. Booleans

```python
is_raining = True
is_sunny = False

# Boolean operations
print(not is_raining)    # False
print(is_raining and is_sunny)  # False
print(is_raining or is_sunny)   # True
```

#### 4. None Type

```python
result = None  # Represents absence of value
print(result)  # Output: None
```

### 4.3.4 Operators

#### Arithmetic Operators

```python
a = 10
b = 3

print(a + b)   # Addition: 13
print(a - b)   # Subtraction: 7
print(a * b)   # Multiplication: 30
print(a / b)   # Division: 3.3333...
print(a // b)  # Floor division: 3
print(a % b)   # Modulus (remainder): 1
print(a ** b)  # Exponentiation: 1000
```

#### Comparison Operators

```python
x = 5
y = 10

print(x == y)  # Equal: False
print(x != y)  # Not equal: True
print(x < y)   # Less than: True
print(x > y)   # Greater than: False
print(x <= y)  # Less than or equal: True
print(x >= y)  # Greater than or equal: False
```

#### Logical Operators

```python
p = True
q = False

print(p and q)  # Logical AND: False
print(p or q)   # Logical OR: True
print(not p)    # Logical NOT: False
```

#### Assignment Operators

```python
score = 100

score += 10   # Same as: score = score + 10
print(score)  # 110

score -= 5    # Same as: score = score - 5
print(score)  # 105

score *= 2    # Same as: score = score * 2
print(score)  # 210
```

## 4.4 Input/Output and Basic Control Structures

### 4.4.1 Input and Output

#### Output with print()

```python
print("Hello, World!")
print("The answer is", 42)
print("Name:", "Alice", "Age:", 25)

# Formatted output
name = "Bob"
age = 30
print(f"My name is {name} and I am {age} years old.")
```

#### Input with input()

```python
# Getting user input (always returns a string)
name = input("Enter your name: ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")

# Converting input to numbers
age_str = input("Enter your age: ")
age = int(age_str)  # Convert string to integer
print(f"You are {age} years old.")

# Or in one line
height = float(input("Enter your height in meters: "))
print(f"Your height is {height} meters.")
```

### 4.4.2 Control Structures

#### If-Else Statements

```python
# Basic if statement
temperature = 25

if temperature > 30:
    print("It's hot!")
elif temperature > 20:
    print("It's warm.")
elif temperature > 10:
    print("It's cool.")
else:
    print("It's cold!")
```

#### Practical Example: Grade Calculator

```python
score = int(input("Enter your score (0-100): "))

if score >= 90:
    grade = "A"
elif score >= 80:
    grade = "B"
elif score >= 70:
    grade = "C"
elif score >= 60:
    grade = "D"
else:
    grade = "F"

print(f"Your grade is: {grade}")
```

#### Loops

##### For Loops

```python
# Loop through a range of numbers
for i in range(5):
    print(f"Count: {i}")
# Output: Count: 0, Count: 1, Count: 2, Count: 3, Count: 4

# Loop through a range with start and end
for i in range(1, 6):
    print(f"Number: {i}")
# Output: Number: 1, Number: 2, Number: 3, Number: 4, Number: 5

# Loop through a string
word = "Python"
for letter in word:
    print(letter)
# Output: P, y, t, h, o, n (each on a new line)
```

##### While Loops

```python
# Basic while loop
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(f"Count is: {count}")
    count += 1

# User input validation
while True:
    user_input = input("Enter 'quit' to exit: ")
    if user_input.lower() == 'quit':
        break
    print(f"You entered: {user_input}")
```

## 4.5 Writing and Running Python Scripts

### 4.5.1 Creating Your First AI-Related Script

Let's create a simple script that demonstrates basic AI concepts:

**File: `simple_ai_demo.py`**

```python
"""
Simple AI Demo - Basic Decision Making
This script demonstrates basic decision-making logic
that could be used in AI systems.
"""

def analyze_weather(temperature, humidity, wind_speed):
    """
    Analyze weather conditions and provide recommendations.
    This is a simple rule-based system similar to expert systems in AI.
    """
    print("=== Weather Analysis System ===")
    print(f"Temperature: {temperature}Â°C")
    print(f"Humidity: {humidity}%")
    print(f"Wind Speed: {wind_speed} km/h")
    print()

    # Decision logic
    recommendations = []

    if temperature > 30:
        recommendations.append("It's hot - stay hydrated!")
    elif temperature < 10:
        recommendations.append("It's cold - dress warmly!")

    if humidity > 80:
        recommendations.append("High humidity - expect muggy conditions")
    elif humidity < 30:
        recommendations.append("Low humidity - moisturize your skin")

    if wind_speed > 25:
        recommendations.append("Windy conditions - secure loose objects")

    # Output recommendations
    if recommendations:
        print("Recommendations:")
        for i, rec in enumerate(recommendations, 1):
            print(f"{i}. {rec}")
    else:
        print("Weather conditions are normal - enjoy your day!")

def main():
    """Main function to run the weather analysis."""
    print("Welcome to the AI Weather Advisor!")
    print()

    try:
        # Get user input
        temp = float(input("Enter temperature (Â°C): "))
        humidity = float(input("Enter humidity (%): "))
        wind = float(input("Enter wind speed (km/h): "))

        # Validate input
        if not (0 <= humidity <= 100):
            print("Warning: Humidity should be between 0-100%")

        # Analyze weather
        analyze_weather(temp, humidity, wind)

    except ValueError:
        print("Error: Please enter valid numbers!")

# Run the program
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### 4.5.2 Running Python Scripts

There are several ways to run Python scripts:

1. **Command Line**:

   ```bash
   python simple_ai_demo.py
   ```

2. **In VS Code**: Press F5 or use the Run button.

3. **In IDLE**: Open the file and press F5.

### 4.5.3 Python Interactive Mode

You can also run Python interactively:

```bash
python
```

This opens the Python interpreter where you can type commands directly:

```python
>>> print("Hello, AI!")
Hello, AI!
>>> x = 5
>>> y = 10
>>> print(x + y)
15
>>> exit()
```

## 4.6 Practical Examples

### 4.6.1 Simple Pattern Recognition

```python
def recognize_pattern(sequence):
    """
    Simple pattern recognition - detect if a sequence is arithmetic.
    This demonstrates basic pattern analysis used in AI.
    """
    if len(sequence) < 3:
        return "Sequence too short to determine pattern"

    # Check for arithmetic progression
    diff = sequence[1] - sequence[0]
    for i in range(2, len(sequence)):
        if sequence[i] - sequence[i-1] != diff:
            return "No arithmetic pattern detected"

    return f"Arithmetic sequence with common difference: {diff}"

# Test the function
numbers = [2, 5, 8, 11, 14]
result = recognize_pattern(numbers)
print(f"Sequence: {numbers}")
print(f"Pattern: {result}")
```

### 4.6.2 Basic Search Algorithm

```python
def linear_search(data, target):
    """
    Linear search algorithm - fundamental to many AI search techniques.
    Returns the index of the target if found, -1 otherwise.
    """
    for i in range(len(data)):
        if data[i] == target:
            return i
    return -1

# Test the search
cities = ["New York", "London", "Tokyo", "Paris", "Sydney"]
search_city = "Tokyo"
index = linear_search(cities, search_city)

if index != -1:
    print(f"Found '{search_city}' at position {index}")
else:
    print(f"'{search_city}' not found")
```

        choice = input("Enter your choice (1-5): ")

        if choice == '5':
            print("Goodbye!")
            break
        elif choice in ['1', '2', '3', '4']:
            # Your code here: get two numbers and perform the operation
            pass
        else:
            print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")

# Test your assistant
calculator()
```
