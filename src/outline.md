# Course Title: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence - Practical Applications

## Course Description

This course is a hands-on introduction to Artificial Intelligence (AI), focusing on practical techniques for solving problems. You’ll learn the basics of AI concepts and algorithms by working with two programming languages: Prolog and Python. We’ll start with Prolog, a logic-based language commonly used in AI for tasks like knowledge representation and reasoning. Then, we’ll move on to Python, a powerful and widely-used language for AI development, where you’ll implement search algorithms, optimization techniques, and strategies for game-playing.

By the end of the course, you’ll have a strong foundation in AI programming. You’ll understand key concepts like search methods, heuristic optimization, constraint satisfaction, and decision-making in games. Most importantly, you’ll gain the skills to build AI systems and tackle real-world challenges through practical implementation.
